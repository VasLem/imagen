function expectation = fitscalingprop(obj)
%FITSCALINGPROP Proportional fitness scaling (single objective only).
%   EXPECTATION = FITSCALINGPROP(SCORES,NPARENTS) calculates the EXPECTATION
%   using the SCORES and number of parents NPARENTS. The least sophisticated 
%   fitness scaling strategy, expectation is simply proportional to the raw 
%   fitness score. This strategy has weaknesses when raw scores are not in a
%   "good range".
%
%   Example:
%   Create an options structure using FITSCALINGPROP as the fitness scaling
%   function
%     options = gaoptimset('FitnessScalingFcn',@fitscalingprop);
